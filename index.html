                        <p><span class="bold">I have a burning passion for life and all it has to offer!</span> This open mindset inspires me to try new things, build relationships with people and confront new challenges. My past experiences are diverse and make up who I am; working in a traveling circus at age 13, founding a successful dot.com at age 20, working for burmese refugees rights in Asia and Sweden, climbing the large corporation career ladder, bar manager in London and C.T.O at one of the fastest growing SMS aggregators in the world. I come from a family of entrepreneurs and have always been driven to make the best of every situation. During college I was an active member of several student organizations and was heavily involved in politics. My ability to motivate people and sense of humor has made me a valuable asset to all of these groups. Mix in a little skydiving, skateboarding, fire juggling, story-telling, acting and you have me! I think of life as a role-playing game and believe that everything should be tried once because regardless of the outcome, I've gained valuable experience-points.</p>                        
                        <p><span class="bold">I'm a technical project manager with a diverse background in IT</span> and thrive when working alongside creative, high energy people. I often approach projects from a business development standpoint in order to provide a fitting solution. My ability to see patterns and find new angles to problems without re-inventing the wheel makes me valuable to most organizations. I am comfortable confronting complex systems and situations and quickly cut through the minor issues en route to a prompt solution.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">I have worked as a developer, team-leader and project manager with</span> focus on web-related systems (no, I don't design home pages!) for more than 15 years. Much of my spare time is spent researching new techniques and keeping relevant with all the rumors, news and cutting edge developments from the IT world. I don't consider myself a programmer but do spend a substantial amount of time hammering away at code. With several years of system-architecture and a software engineer education in my backpack I'm accomplished in the building and scaling of prototypes as well as proof-of-concept solutions. I love raw-data and believe it is the foundation of all good systems and decisions. As a result, I spend a significant amount of time normalizing data, tinkering with datasets and exploring databases.</p>                        
                        <p><span class="bold">I am fluent in English and Swedish with a decent grasp of German</span>. When at a loss for words, I tend to gesture wildly in hopes of bridging the language gap. All joking aside, communication is one of my biggest assets. It extends beyond everyday conversation to being a confident public speaker and a great author of documentation. I respect the opportunity that arises when communication thrives and ideas and thoughts are cultivated. I strive to inspire and am motivated to bring out the best in people.</p>                        
                        <p><span class="bold">As a project-manager I am appreciated for my abilities to make thorough</span> plans as well as apply processes and methods to aid resources in reaching the common goal. I like Gantts and love burndown-charts. I have always been able to solve the problems that were put in front of me by learning about the particular field, dissecting the relevant factors and becoming acquainted with the underlying issues.</p>                      
                        <p><span class="bold">I am good in team-leader and management-roles but also positions that involves</span> development, technical sales, internal marketing and training. I look at the prospect of re-locating to another country for work as an opportunity, not a burden and enjoy business travel.</p>                         
                        <p><span class="bold">My interests involve a wide range of activities spanning from doing fire-shows</span> to nerd out over some weird topic. I recently discovered rock-climbing and it quickly became a new passion. Other than that I surf and enjoy spending time in the gym. I try to travel at least once a year and have a small cottage in the north of Sweden that I strive to maintain upkeep on. I collect trivia and useless knowledge like a leprechaun collects gold and love to tell stories. What I do for a living is also a large part of my life. As such, I have to believe in it and enjoy it. I believe that it is possible to get rich without doing harm and that is my ambition.</p>                      
                        <p><span class="bold">Over the years I have had the good fortune to work with some amazing people.</span> A life long search for role-models and mentors is a valuable and important quest for me. Maybe we will have the pleasure of working together someday.</p>                     
                        <p><span class="bold">I'm Christian</span></p>

It allows you to try new things and encourages failure, it challenges you to try new things and reminds you to stand on the already existing shoulders of giants! I have finished a Bachelors degree in Computer Science where I have specialized in mobile platforms such as Android-development and iOS. I achieved highest grades in most courses and I also worked as T.A. during my education at the same time I was contracted at Beepsend. My thesis paper on user interface design saw a lot of recognition and has been known to be used as reference reading at Apple Australia.</p>

                        <p>My interest in the structure of a global world and its history has led me to study social sciences and international politics. In my travels and my studies for a teachers-degree, I often end up discussing the role of U.S. politics in the world and decided I wanted a better understanding of the nuts and bolts of it.</p>
                        <p>In 2008, I enrolled at UCSD taking classes in The Presidency, US Foreign Policy and International Crisis Diplomacy which gave me several new perspectives on the topics. Overall this gave me further understanding of interpreting the motives behind countries actions as well as how companies best align themselves for advantages in the future. The courses in crisis diplomacy taught me how to stay organized, calm and collected when working with impossible odds in extreme chaos.</p>

                        <p>JoelOnSoftware said it so brilliantly. Based on a similar chain of thought I founded a small consultancy-firm, specializing in lectures about new (social) media and technology, help development teams plan and coordinate development and design great software that brings existing business-models to the web.</p>
                        <p>The company has been very successful albeit as a single resource lonely at times. My intention is not to grow, but be a one-man company, however my heart is in working with groups of people achieving a greater goal.</p>

                        <p>In 1892 - Observer was founded as the only service to monitor and interpret what was communicated in "media", a very loose term at the time. In 1999 Agent25.se opened its business with automated search-agents and became the first real competitor to Observer. The digital age had changed the rules of the game and Observer needed to understand it fast. This led to the recruitment of me as a visionary to explain where the market was going and what Observers role in it could be.</p>
                        <p>In 2001 a brain-trust with me and a few others presented our solution and a re-vamped business model to the board. Through this I was granted funding to spearhead the design and implementation of a system that in real-time would scan electronic sources, parse them and use the existing search-terms from customers to filter the content. If would also allow for manual verification and analysis, as well as direct delivery in several channel. All this technology and the concepts was unheard of at the time and the system turned out to be a huge success.</p>
                        <p>Today this is the main product of a revamped and reformed Observer, now named Cision and this has spearheaded my career from that date onwards.</p>

                        <p>Together with some clever business-people, a bunch of game-developers and one "happy vibe-spreader" I set forth to create a haven for brilliant people to work in a new company. This was in the middle of the dot-com era and as such we met little resistance. By having a wide competence in-house, resources scattered around the world in several time-zones and a work-climate that stimulated creativity and curiosity we were taking Sweden with storm in 1999. The idea was that code would constantly be worked on in some part of the world and taking leverage of the overlap we would be able to gain 36 hours out of the 24 of a day.</p>
                        <p>We quickly gained necessary V.C., bought two companies, released our first full-feature game, initiated a convention and set up satellite-offices in U.S.A and Australia. I was in charge of all web-oriented development and was a critical member in the moulding of vision and business development.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">Year:</span> 2004
            <p><span class="bold">Ambition:</span> Building a highly customizable, intuitive and scalable CRM-system. The system had to support several levels of security for users and groups tied to several languages and several markets. Administrators in one market can easily set up a whole site by copying data from another market and translate language, but still be able to have a completly different design. The system also allowed for external linking but with embedded search of that linked content. The back-end sported a TinyMCE-editor, drag-n-drop arranging of the meny-structure and ability to build drafts before publishing. The system was used by a large medical coorporation for all their subsidiaries with multi-language support. </p>
            <p><span class="bold">Architecture: </span> The front-end uses a custom-made template-system in HTML4.01 Strict and PHP5 as engine. This allows for different designs with same dataset. The back-end relies on PHP5 and the javascript framework prototype to enable animations and drag-n-drop support. The interface for the CMS was inspired by K.I.S.S. and the goal was to keep the interface clean.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">Year:</span> 2008
            <p><span class="bold">Ambition:</span> To build a customizable and agile point-of-sale system that is shaped to support the business by enforcing policies but allow for exceptions. The system guides and facilitates the user to a correct and efficient sale. The system automates sale-statistics, bookeeping and commision-calculation as well as improves order-handling and correct inventory with the webstore. Automatic price-suggestion and markup-tracking of individual items as well as a re-worked and normalized inventory-system was included in the release.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Architecture: </span> PHP5 using OOP, jQuery framework for logic on client, MySQL 5 using a combination of InnoDB and MyISAM. Singleton database-layer and JSON for data between server and client. Client verifications of data consistency as well as server check and validation with exception-handling and transaction-support. Client performs a round-robin validity-check of what was store in database per checkout and boasts automatic logging of errors, inconsistencies and discrepancies to administrators without interrupting user.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">Year:</span> 2006
            <p><span class="bold">Ambition:</span> By using Google Maps as a base-layer and let different organizations highlight areas of interest and tie that to pictures, document and movies in real-time. I wanted to show how a crisis-area in the world is topic for several organizations in different ways but also let a map be the index on which information is stacked.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">Architecture: </span> After reviewing several techniques to solve our need to draw on top of the map before the API itself had this functionality we decided to move ahead with a combination of Flash and PHP5+js. Flash is used in the studio where maps are create and in the view-mode html4.01 and js was used. A logic-layer to handle all map-data and stream pointers from server to client as well as re-draw and bounding-box tests was written in javascript. This allowed the system to scale nicely by utilizing the power of each connected client instead of using the server.</p>

            <p><span class="headerText bold">EldsjÃ¤l - a community for fire-artist</span></p>
            <p><span class="bold">Year:</span> 2002
            <p><span class="bold">Ambition:</span> On my spare-time I started dabbling with a proof-of-concept for a community. I wanted to base it on some new organizational structural ideas I had about openess and integrating a social interaction-layer into the digital platform. I wanted to create a social platform that trancended age and cultural differences. I based it on what I came to call periphiral arts, such as fire-performing, juggling and acrobatics. This attracted an interesting crowd and my community that I built from scratch sported among other things a social time-line, something unheard of and quite controversal at the time. One year after launch the organization was granted funding from the government for further research in the effects of direct-democracy. I learned a lot about how to maintain stability in an organization that relies heavily on voluntary efforts. It is to this date a vibrant and active organization with almost 2000 members and daily activities all over Sweden.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Architecture: </span> The solution is based on MSSQL and ASP3.0. The community has several layers of security and has many tools for administration. As such I could delegate maintainence of the platform. It has dynamic support for plugins and a embedded structure for validity-checking of profiles and queue-handling. The database uses stored procedures to lift the burden of the not so efficient ASP-technology. Even in prototype-code the community had lightning-fast response-times thought it had over 1000 members and ran smooth on Pentium II with 512mb though hundreds of parallell users were online.</p>
            <p class="quote">"He was the heart and soul of the project and his devotion was remarkable and highly admirable.

            <p><span class="bold">Year:</span> 2006
            <p><span class="bold">Ambition:</span> Tific is a high-tech company building support-automation and intelligent self-service systems. They have several software products a lot of news and updates as well as file-areas for white-papers. They needed a website that functioned as a tool for communication rather than being a static presentation. They also needed help to organize and structure all information and find a good way of guiding the visitors to the right information rather than throw everything at once. Finally the website had to be administrated by not tech-savvy people but had to breath freshness.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Architecture: </span> The system plugs in to their existing servers but isolates the databases. The site plugs into their mail-server and has a VPN-connected file-area for document. The site uses unobtrusive ajax and pre-loaded pages for common paths.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">Ambition:</span> Expand the business by offering a bunch of services in relation to the main product, which is medication. For this I developed a subscription-based service that validates a mobile phone and every morning for X days sends the latest prognose of pollen in the air. It keeps track of message-counts, schedules send-outs and allows for re-activation over the phone.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">Architecture: </span> In the background a database that holds subscribers and allows for the client to modify each of all messages being sent out. To make it more personally I build support for a set of different messages being picked at random each morning. The system hooked up with a SMS-provider through API and I wrote a layer of error-detection and rule-set to act accordingly.</p>
